# Soccer-Scraper
This is a simple scraper that fetches data from a soccer prediction site using requests and Beautiful Soup, then saves the data in an Excel file






# Scrapper_Branch
In the new branch, I incorporated the halftime scores and leagues/countries of home and away teams and saved them to an Excel file making it easier to do an analysis
